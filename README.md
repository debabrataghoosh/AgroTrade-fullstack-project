This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Chat System Setup

For the real-time chat functionality to work, you need to run both the Next.js app and the Socket.IO server.

### Option 1: Run Both Servers Together (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will start both the Next.js app (port 3000) and the Socket.IO server (port 3001) simultaneously.

### Option 2: Run Servers Separately
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Next.js app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Socket.IO server
npm run socket
```

Make sure both servers are running for the chat functionality to work properly.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
